# RTCPeerConnection shim
This repository contains an implementation of the [W3C RTCPeerConnection API](http://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/)
as a shim ontop of the [ORTC API](http://draft.ortc.org/) provided by [Microsoft Edge](https://twitter.com/msedgedev).

It was added to [adapter.js](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter) in late 2015
but in 2017 was being split out for easier maintenance.

# Q&A
## This is crazy, ORTC is the better API!
Yes. This is internally known as the wicked shim of the west.

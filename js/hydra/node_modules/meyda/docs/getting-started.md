# Getting Started

Meyda is a Javascript Library that can listen to audio and output a selection of
statistics that describe it. Meyda has a variety of different applications, and
environments it can be used in. Lets take a look at some.

## What can you do with Meyda?
You can get audio analysis of
* Audio playing in real time in your browser
* Audio that's stored in buffers or arrays in your browser
* Audio that's stored on disk as a wav file
* Audio that you've loaded in Node.js

You can use these analyses in
* Real Time Audio Visualizations
* Machine Learning
* Visual Score Generation
* Music Recommendation
* ...and anything else you can think of!

## What's in these audio analyses?
Meyda can calculate a wide variety of standard audio features, including
loudness, spectral characteristics like brightness (spectral centroid) and
noisiness (flatness) and much more. For a full list and explanation of the audio
features Meyda supports, please see [our audio feature reference document]
[audio-features].

## How can you do these things with Meyda?
Please have a look through the following tutorials for the one that closest
matches your needs.

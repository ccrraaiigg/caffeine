Caffeine is a livecoding environment for [web browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US), [Deno](https://deno.land), and [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly). After adding it to a webpage, you can use it to make live persistent changes to that page and other pages running Caffeine, without reloading.

You can interact with Caffeine from JavaScript in several ways:

- as a headless Web Worker, with which you post and receive messages (you are responsible for all DOM manipulation).
- as an IDE in a headful IFrame, with Caffeine able to manipulate the DOM directly.
- on a headless Deno server, with which you also exchange messages (over a WebSocket).
- through a headful DevTools panel IDE, using the Chrome Debugging Protocol to manipulate every page your browser is running.

Caffeine's underlying computation engine is [SqueakJS](https://squeak.js.org), an open-source [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), assisted by dynamically-generated [WebAssembly](https://wikiwand.com/en/Webassembly). It features a bi-directional JavaScript bridge, enabling Smalltalk methods to send messages to JavaScript objects, and provide Smalltalk block closures as JavaScript promises or callback functions. Caffeine includes the [Epigram](https://thiscontext.com/2022/06/28/epigram-reifying-grammar-production-rules-for-clearer-parsing-compiling-and-searching) parser and compiler framework, with which I have written compilers for Smalltalk, SVG, Protocol Buffers, and WebAssembly.

Caffeine has support for [Squeak](http://squeak.org), [Pharo](https://pharo.org), [Cuis](http://cuis-smalltalk.org), 3D VR (via [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) and [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org)), zooming 3D presentations (via [impress.js](https://impress.js.org)), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org), [WebMIDI](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi), [Observable](https://observablehq.com), [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), [DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caffeine/jhbbonmkjnodgkammmgfhaljmicpeakb) and many other JS frameworks.

You can read more about the design of Caffeine, and new features, at my blog, [https://thiscontext.com](https://thiscontext.com). Check out the [teaser trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VzXmgAQWjc&t=8s) on YouTube.

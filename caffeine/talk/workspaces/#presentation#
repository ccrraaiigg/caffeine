intro

     Hi, this is Craig Latta from Black Page Digital. Here's
a livecoding environment I wrote called Caffeine. Livecoding
is writing software while you're running it. A good vehicle
for livecoding is the JavaScript engine in the web browser
you're using right now.

     Web apps are dynamic media under the hood. They can be
that way when we're developing and presenting, too. Caffeine
brings the Smalltalk livecoding model to the dynamic
JavaScript built into every web browser.

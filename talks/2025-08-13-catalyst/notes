     Catalyst: a WASM GC Open Smalltalk virtual machine with
     LLM-assisted method translation

abstract

     Now that WebAssembly does garbage collection, I'm curious to see
how Smalltalk can participate in the WASM module ecosystem, with
optimal performance, both in web browsers and WASI environments. I'm
writing an Open Smalltalk virtual machine for WASM GC, called
Catalyst. It builds upon the Epigram compiler framework I wrote,
decompiling a Smalltalk implementation to WASM GC. It uses AI to
optimize translate method instructions to more efficient sequences,
and compiles the translations to WASM. It'll be interesting to see how
much performance is lost or gained by leaving register allocation to
the underlying WASM engine.

bio

     Craig Latta is a research computer scientist in Berkeley and
Amsterdam, with interests including livecoding, music performance, and
interactive visualization. The discovery of a mysteriously-placed Blue
Book at university led to stints at several exploratory labs, and a
pursuit of improvisation wherever code is found. His current work
focuses on polyglot computing with WebAssembly, the novel compiler
framework Epigram, and human augmentation through AI.

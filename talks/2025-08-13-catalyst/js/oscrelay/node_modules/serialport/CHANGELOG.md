### BREAKING CHANGES

* **binaries:** We switched to `prebuild` a breaking change because it's substantially changes our install processes. It's also possible the install flags to ensure downloading or building from source has changed slightly. That's not our api per say, but it's enough.
* **windows:** We previously hard coded to have RTS on for windows at all times it now default to off.


Version 5.0.0 ðŸŽ‰
-------------
Nearly [a year in the making](https://github.com/node-serialport/node-serialport/compare/4.0.7...5.0.0-beta9) Node SerialPort 5.0.0 is a major rewrite that improves stability, compatibility and performance. The api surface is similar to version 4 there have been a number of changes to ensure consistent error handling and operation of a serial port. Notably we are now a [`Stream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)! We can also introduce a bindings layer. A small low level api to provide access to underlying hardware. External bindings written in other languages or targeting other platforms can now be used.

Some major cpu performance gains on unix platforms can be found and we're less buggy and better performing on Windows too.

With this release we are now only supporting LTS nodejs platforms and we are dropping NodeJS 0.10, 0.12, 5 and 7 support. We loved directly supporting so many platforms but it was getting in the way making a solid library.

See our [upgrade guide](./UPGRADE_GUIDE.md) for detail on what to change to upgrade your app to use `serialport@5.0.0`. It's not much!

Thank you to the 25 people who committed code and documentation and every person who submitted bug reports and tested changes!

Version 4.0.1
-------------
- [linux] Do not replace the native Promise when it is available thanks to @zewish for the fix

Version 4.0.0
-------------
- Requiring `serialport` now returns the SerialPort constructor function instead of a factory object. `SerialPort.SerialPort` is now deprecated.
- `SerialPort` constructor now throws on argument errors immediately.
- `.write(writeCallback)` now only calls it's callback once after the entire write operation, it used to be called for each write cycle and return the bytes written. This reduces the number of callbacks by hundreds of thousands over a megabyte at low bandwidth.
- Disconnections now always attempt to close the port, and you'll always get a `close` event after a `disconnect` event
- All callbacks are called in the context of the port, `this` now equals the port.
- Removed `openImmediately` from the constructor's api, the functionality is now named `autoOpen` on the options object.
- Removed extraneous flow control settings from the `flowControl` option, use the specific options to set these flags now.
- Removed undocumented callbacks from the options object `disconnectedCallback` and `dataCallback`
- Renamed `serialportlist` to `serialport-list`
- Renamed `serialportterm` to `serialport-term`
- Added a contributors guide
- Added our first Arduino required integration tests
- [unix] `.drain` and `.set` now properly report errors
- [unix] Ports are now locked by default with the new `lock` options matches windows default behavior
- [windows] `.update()` now supports windows for changing baud rates
- [windows] Fixed a bug where we weren't properly opening ports (provides better support virtual com ports too) thanks to @RogerHardiman
- [windows] known issue `lock: false` doesn't work (no change in behavior)

Version 3.1.2
-------------
- Documentation around "Illegal Instruction" errors
- Resolve some ambiguities around publishing that was causing some issues on some versions and platforms of npm and node
- [linux] bug fix in `.list()` where we weren't filtering out non block devices that are named like serial ports
- [unix] Better unix error messages
- [unix] Refactor `setBaudrate` for Unix making it easier for custom baudRate support
- [unix] Update now has less memory leaks, documentation and better error messages
- [windows] Better error messages for opening ports

Version 3.1.1
-------------

- Experimental node 6 support

Version 3.0.0
-------------
- `close` and `disconnect` events no longer call `removeAllListeners` and removes your event listeners. This was particularly bad for the `error` event. This is the only change and if you didn't have a special code to deal with this behavior you should probably upgrade from v2.1.2

Version 2.1.2
-------------
- Start bundling node-pre-gyp but upgrade it to the latest as the previous version doesn't install

Version 2.1.1

- Fix binary paths to confirm with modern standards
- Integration tests on CI's that support it or for the folks at home with an arduino handy
- Upgrade to nan-2.2.1 for memory leak fixes and node 6 compatibility (still not supported)
- Confirm nw.js and electron compatibility
- Make the outpout of `.list` consistent between platforms and docs
- Define ambiguous flow control flags and document them
- Fix support systems who provide 0 as a valid file descriptor
- Fix race conditions when opening and closing ports that led to errors while reading and writing while closing or opening the port.
- [unix] Fix a double open bug on unix that would cause opening and closing ports repetitively to error.
- [unix] Listing serialports on linux now include more ports (including bluetooth devices eg. `/dev/rfcommXX`) and have less bugs in the output
- [windows] Remove deprecated BuildCommDCB for windows 10 support
- [windows] Fix a memory leak on windows
- [windows] Fix a 100% cpu and possible hang bug when ports were disconnected on windows.

-------------
- Cleanup minor Unix gcc warnings, Thanks @rwaldron

Version 2.0.1
-------------
- El Capitan Support, thanks @tmpvar

Version 2.0.0
-------------

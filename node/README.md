SqueakJS: A Squeak VM for the Web
=================================

SqueakJS is an HTML5 runtime engine for [Squeak][squeak]</a> Smalltalk written in pure JavaScript by Bert Freudenberg.

The interpreter core is in "vm.js" and plugins are in the "plugins" directory. The Just-in-Time compiler is optional ("jit.js") and can be easily replaced with your own. There are two user interfaces: the regular HTML interface lets you use SqueakJS on your own web page. Just include "squeak.js". The other interface provides a visual debugger implemented also in JavaScript using [Lively][lively]. This does not use "squeak.js" but reimplements the UI in Lively Morphic.

For discussions, please use the [vm-dev mailing list][vm-dev]. Also, please visit the [project home page][homepage]!

Running it
----------
**Simplest**

* [Run a minimal image][mini]. This is the simple demo included in this repo.
* Or run [Etoys][etoys]. Everything except the image and template files is in this repo.
* Or similarly, [Scratch][scratch], also in here.
* Go to the [SqueakJS debugger][debug] page with the Lively interface.

**Run your own Squeak image**

* Drag an image from your local files into the [launcher][run].
* You can also drag files into the [Lively Debugger][debug] page.
* ... and all the other demo pages (see above) accept dropped images, too.

**Which Browser**

All modern browsers should work (Chrome, Safari, IE, FireFox), though Chrome performs best currently. Safari on iPad works somewhat. YMMV.
Fixes to improve browser compatibility are highly welcome!


Installing locally
------------------
**Without Lively (simpler)**

* download and unpack the [ZIP archive][zip] (or clone the [github repo][repo])
* serve the SqueakJS directory using a local web server.

  TIP: If you have python try out something like
  ```
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9090
  ```
* in your web browser, open the SqueakJS/demo/simple.html file

Now Squeak should be running.
The reason for having to run from a web server is because the image is loaded with an XMLHttpRequest which does not work with a file URL. Alternatively, you could just open SqueakJS/run/index.html and drop in a local image.

**In Lively (nicer for debugging)**

* install [Lively][lively]
* inside the Lively directory, make a "users/bert" folder and put the SqueakJS directory there
* open the blank.html page using your web browser
* get a Squeak morph from the PartsBin
* save the world under a different name

How to modify it
----------------
**In Lively**

* if you installed with Lively, use that to change the code
* all changes take effect immediately

**Without Lively**

* use any text editor
* you have to reload the page for your changes to take effect

How to share your changes
-------------------------
* easiest for me is if you create a [pull request][pullreq]
* otherwise, send me patches

Contributions are very welcome!

Things to work on
-----------------
SqueakJS is intended to run any Squeak image. It can already load anything from the original 1996 Squeak release to the latest 2016 release. But various pieces (primitives in various plugins) are still missing, in particular media support (MIDI, 3D graphics). Also, it would be nice to make it work on as many browsers as possible, especially on mobile touch devices.

As for optimizing I think the way to go is an optimizing JIT compiler. The current JIT is very simple and does not optimize at all. Since we can't access or manipulate the JavaScript stack, we might want that compiler to inline as much as possible, but keep the call sequence flat so we can return to the browser at any time. Even better (but potentially more complicated) is actually using the JavaScript stack, just like Eliot's Stack VM uses the C stack. To make BitBlt fast, we could probably use WebGL.

To make SqueakJS useful beyond running existing Squeak images, we should use the JavaScript bridge to write a native HTML UI which would certainly be much faster than BitBlt.

Better Networking would be interesting, too. The SocketPlugin currently only allows HTTP requests. How about implementing it more generally via WebSockets? Parallelize the VM with WebWorkers?

There's a gazillion exciting things to do :)

This is a quick-and-dirty fork of
https://github.com/ErikOnBike/SqueakJS/tree/nodejs. I intend to merge
it with https://github.com/bertfreudenberg/SqueakJS, and with the work
I've already done on running SqueakJS headlessly in Web Workers in web
browsers, elsewhere in this repository.

Install ndb (https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ndb) and run "ndb
squeak_node.js". That runs an alpha version of a team livecoding
services relay network; happy hacking. :)

<!--

         This is a container for a live Caffeine system, run by the
    SqueakJS virtual machine and suitable for inclusion in larger
    webpages.

         As many elements as possible (for example, text-recognizer)
    should be created and inserted dynamically by Caffeine when it
    resumes, not expressed statically here. In this early era of
    development, we prototype with handwritten elements (either in
    HTML files or in the web browser's devtools), and move them to
    Caffeine after they're stable. Ultimately, we'd like to provide
    all the devtools functionality from Caffeine, since some host
    platforms (like iOS and iPadOS) don't provide access to them from
    their web browsers.

	 This invisible text-recognizer element should be created and
    inserted dynamically by Caffeine, not expressed here. We use it to
    capture recognized Apple QuickPath swiped-keyboard gestures and
    Apple Scribble stylus handwriting, for redisplay in
    Smalltalk-rendered UIs.

         Whenever a Smalltalk-rendered text field gets Smalltalk
    focus, Caffeine gives DOM focus to the recognizer element, and
    positions it to match the dimensions of the field. Initially, the
    element is intended for use with QuickPath, and is placed below
    Caffeine's DOM canvas. After a two-finger tap, Caffeine raises the
    element above the canvas, making it usable for Scribble. (A
    two-finger drag is a separate gesture, and invokes a different
    feature.) Scribble and QuickPath are usable simultaneously.

         While using Scribble, stylus input originating inside the
    field is displayed and used as ink, not pointer events. Some
    familiar Scribble behavior that mixes pointing and scribbling is
    therefore not available; we only have 'inputchanged' events from
    the element. This means, however, that we can always use the
    entire field for text entry. This is in contrast to the
    unpredictable and destructive edits one gets by scribbling new
    words over existing text in the Apple Notes app.

         After a further one-finger tap, Caffeine lowers the element
    offscreen, so that one may use the stylus for pointer events in
    the field again.
